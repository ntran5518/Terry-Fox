          On April 12, 1980, Terry Fox set out from St. John’s, Newfoundland to
          begin the run across Canada that he named the Marathon of Hope. His
          ambition was to raise a million dollars for cancer research. It wasn’t
          easy. Initial support from communities varied from terrific to nothing
          at all. His prosthetic leg was painful to run on, and there were
          always traffic and extreme weather conditions to deal with. But, by
          the time he reached Ontario – a journey of more than 3,000 kilometres
          – word of his achievement had spread, and thousands cheered him and
          followed his progress. Terry’s spirits soared, and now he hoped to
          raise $22 million dollars – one dollar for every Canadian. He
          succeeded in this ambition, but the Marathon of Hope ended near
          Thunder Bay, Ontario on September 1, 1980. The cancer had spread to
          his lungs, and, after running 24 miles in one day, on the next he
          could run no further.
